## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot find module" errors
```bash
# Make sure you installed all dependencies
npm install --prefix backend
npm install --prefix frontend
```

### "Invalid API key"
- Get a key at https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
- Make sure it's in `backend/.env`
- No quotes needed around the key
- Key should start with `AIzaSy...`

### "Meeting not starting"
- Wait 15 seconds (engine tick interval)
- Check both participants submitted
- Look for errors in terminal

### Frontend won't load
- Make sure backend started first
- Check port 4000 isn't in use
- Try http://localhost:5174 (not 5173)
