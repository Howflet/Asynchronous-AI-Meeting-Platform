## üî¥ Critical Fixes (Must Have Before Demo)

### 1. **Fix Report Display** - HIGH PRIORITY
**Issue**: Reports are generated but `check-report.js` looks for wrong column
- Reports stored in separate `reports` table
- Script looks for `meeting.report` column (doesn't exist)
- UI likely has same issue

**Fix Needed**:
```javascript
// In check-report.js and frontend Report page
const report = db.prepare('SELECT * FROM reports WHERE meetingId = ? ORDER BY createdAt DESC LIMIT 1').get(meetingId);
```

### 2. **Visual Polish - Main Pages**
**Current State**: Functional but basic styling
**Needed**:
- [ ] Add proper logo/branding header
- [ ] Improve color scheme consistency
- [ ] Better typography (headers, body text)
- [ ] Add icons for status indicators
- [ ] Improve "paused" alert prominence (bigger, animated)
- [ ] Add "AI is thinking..." indicator with animated dots

### 3. **Loading States**
**Needed**:
- [ ] Show spinner during meeting creation
- [ ] "Generating personas..." loading message
- [ ] "AI is deliberating..." when moderator decides next speaker
- [ ] Turn generation progress indicator

### 4. **Error Handling**
**Current**: Errors go to console only
**Needed**:
- [ ] User-friendly error messages
- [ ] Toast notifications for events
- [ ] Graceful degradation if API fails
- [ ] Retry mechanism for failed API calls

### 5. **Demo Data & Examples**
**Needed**:
- [ ] Pre-filled example meeting on home page
- [ ] "Try Example" button with sample scenario
- [ ] 2-3 different scenarios to choose from:
  - Budget Planning Meeting
  - Product Launch Strategy
  - Team Conflict Resolution
